You send data to the backend that is basicaly a struct:

{
    command_id,
    invocation_id,
    ...parameters
}

which first gets parsed by serde as a command (this only reads the id and the other fields are ignored)

then there is a match statement that matches the command is and tries to parse the data as the requested "call signature struct" 
which parses the parameters and if a parameter is missing it returns an error object


Thoughts:
- When creating a context on each connection, what do we do when the connection is lost?
should we add an session protocol?

TODO:
- add events
- connect deltachat

- make async


- we need a modified deltachat core that is able to serialize Events
