You send data to the backend that is basicaly a struct:

{
    command_id,
    ...parameters
}

which first gets parsed by serde as a command (this only reads the id and the other fields are ignored)

then there is a match statement that matches the command is and tries to parse the data as the requested "call signature struct" 
which parses the parameters and if a parameter is missing it returns an error object
